BITTTTCHHH IT FUCKING ISS !!!",

"And the way u laugh oh my god the way u laugh when we ragebait each other on purpose just to see who gets more dramatic 😭😭 i love that we purposely trigger each other and then burst out laughing two seconds later we are actually unhinged and i wouldnt change that for anything frr not even kidding atp",

"I miss us having maggi together so much its criminal 🍜💔 like the cheap masala maggi that tasted better because we were bunking classes and pretending we had important work to do (important work = judging everyone and doing nothing) and i miss us bitching about our english teacher like we were running a news channel and specially the debate part like tf was that... nimbo mirchi and sola eclipse theory was shit assss !!",

"Especially looking down from that place at our english teacher at school acting all innocent while lowkey roasting everything she said 😭😭 i swear we were so bad but also iconic like main character energy always",

"And dont even get me started on dhruv 😒 the way i hate him and the way u purposely say his name just to piss me off i will actually fight u one day but also its funny and i cant even stay mad because u start laughing and then i start laughing and then we are back to being idiots again",

"You have always been there for me through everything the ugly cries the overthinking the random breakdowns when my stupid ass lost money to a scammer being a engineer and that too in cs and and and the drama the chaos the late night rants the i hate everyone days and the i miss everyone days and i dont think i say this enough but i need u like actually need u",

"There are so many times when i feel lost and then i talk to u and suddenly things feel lighter and i feel understood and seen and heard and thats such a rare thing and u do it so effortlessly like its nothing but its everything to me",

"I want u to know that no matter what happens where life takes us who we become who we fight with who we date who we block who we unblock i am always going to be in ur life like permanently stamped there okay no returns no refunds no ntg got it kuhoo ? (well cant hear u say it so imma go with yes) 💌💘",

"I will always be there for u when u feel small when u feel insecure when u feel like u are not enough because u ARE more than enough and i will keep reminding u till it enters ur thick head (lovingly) 😌💗",

"You are strong and soft and chaotic and caring and dramatic and kind and annoying and perfect all at the same time and its my fav combination ever like how did i get so lucky to have u",

"I miss our random walks our pointless arguments our stupid inside jokes that literally no one else understands i miss the way we could sit in silence and it wouldnt be awkward at all just peaceful and warm",

"And btw if u ever doubt urself again just remember u have someone here who thinks u are the most gorgeous stunning brilliant creature to ever exist like actually how do ur eyes do that color thing its not normal its art 🎨👀💖",

"I love how we tease each other how we fake fight how we say the meanest things in the cutest tone and then hug it out (mentally because we are dramatic)",

"You are so important to me its actually scary like the thought of not having u around feels wrong and empty and i dont like it so we are just not going to allow that timeline to exist",

"I promise u i will show up for u every single time u need me even if its 3am even if its stupid even if its just to complain about someone breathing too loud i am THERE",

"And also pls never stop being ur weird funny loud self because thats the version of u i fell in love with as my bestfriend and thats the version i want foreverrrrr",

"Happy birthday my beautiful chaotic magical girl 💕 may this year give u confidence equal to ur beauty happiness equal to ur kindness and success equal to the way u overreact over small things (which is a lot)",

"Stay with me forever okay no escaping i have already decided our future we are gonna grow old together and still hate dhruv and still ragebait each other and still laugh till our stomach hurts",

"I love u i love u i love u always have always will and thats not changing ever 💖💖💖 now go eat cake and think about how lucky u are to have me 😌🎂💞 (YES IM BEING COCKY BUT U KNOW WHAT U GOT INTO BEFORE BEING MY FRIEND SO THERES THAT NTGS GONNA CHANGE)",
